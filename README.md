# PiCode

AI-supported live coding and IoT learning module integrated with Moodle LMS.

## Summary
PiCode is a learning module designed to bring live coding and IoT hands-on activities into Moodle-based courses. It integrates live coding environments and hardware interaction so instructors can deliver interactive exercises and labs inside existing LMS workflows.

## Key features
- Live coding exercises embedded in Moodle pages
- Basic IoT device communication (sensors/actuators) for student labs
- Auto-grading hooks and activity reporting compatible with Moodle gradebook
- Lightweight AI-assisted hints for students (configurable)

## Tech stack
- Moodle plugin / LTI-compatible integration
- Backend: (example) Node.js / Python Flask (adjust to repo)
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS, WebSocket for live code execution
- Optional: Raspberry Pi / microcontroller support via REST/WebSocket bridge

## Quick start
1. Place the plugin files in your Moodle plugin folder and enable in Site administration â†’ Plugins.
2. Configure the IoT bridge endpoint and credentials in plugin settings.
3. Add "PiCode activity" to a course, create an exercise, and assign to students.
